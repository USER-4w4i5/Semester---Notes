 - Def
	- Algo is a well-defined, finite and effective sequence of computation steps that takes some value, or a set of values to as input and gives the output either as some value or set of values
- Algo vs Program
	- Algo is the design of a concept in code
	- Program is the execution of the design
- Correctness of an algo
	- Algo is said to be correct if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output
	- An incorrect algo
		- Might not halt at all for some inputs
		- Might halt with an answer other than desired one
- Problems solved by Algos
	- Practical Applications
		- Shortest path such as Dijkstra or A* algo
		- Matrices multiplication
- Why study algo/performance of algo
	- Helps understand scalability
	- Performance often draws the line b/w what is feasible and what is impossible
		- It is also the currency of computing
	- Algo maths = language for talking about a program's behavior
