## Heartbleed Case Study

- #### **Issue:**
	- Heartbleed is a serious security vulnerability that affected the OpenSSL cryptographic software library, used to secure a significant portion of the internet's communication.
- #### **Discovery:**
	- Discovered by Neel Mehta of Google Security in March 2014.
- #### **Vulnerability:**
	- Heartbleed was a buffer over-read bug, allowing attackers to retrieve up to 64KB of memory content from the server.
	- Attackers could potentially access sensitive data like usernames, passwords, encryption keys, and more, without leaving any trace.
	- The bug was caused by a missing bounds check in the OpenSSL code, allowing an attacker to send malicious Heartbeat requests.
- #### **CVE:**
	- Assigned the identifier CVE-2014-0160.
- #### **Impact:**
	- Heartbleed posed a massive security risk, as it affected a significant portion of internet servers using vulnerable versions of OpenSSL.
	- Websites, online services, and devices relying on OpenSSL for encryption were potentially compromised.
	- The vulnerability remained undetected for about two years before its discovery, leaving ample time for potential exploitation.
- #### **Scope:**
	- It's estimated that around 17% (half a million) of web servers were initially vulnerable.
- #### **Response:**
	- **Patch:** The OpenSSL project released patched versions 1.0.1g to fix the vulnerability.
	- **Public Awareness:** The issue was made public on April 7, 2014, raising awareness among both security professionals and the general public.
	- **Password Changes:** Users were advised to change passwords for services that were potentially affected once the services were patched.
- #### **Aftermath:**
	- **Security Concerns:** The incident highlighted the importance of regular security audits and the potential dangers of open-source software vulnerabilities.
	- **Increased Scrutiny:** The security of open-source projects, particularly widely-used ones, came under increased scrutiny.
- #### **Lessons Learned:**
	- **Code Review:** Emphasized the need for thorough code reviews and security testing in open-source projects.
	- **Security Funding:** Highlighted the challenges of funding and maintaining security for critical open-source software infrastructure.
- #### **Long-Term Impact:**
	- The Heartbleed incident continues to influence discussions around software security, open-source development, and the challenges of maintaining the security of critical internet infrastructure.
