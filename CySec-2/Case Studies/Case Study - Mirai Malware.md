### Mirai Malware Case Study

- **Malware Name:** Mirai
- **Date:** Discovered in 2016
- **Type:** Botnet malware
- #### Background
	- Mirai is a notorious malware that targeted Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as routers, IP cameras, and DVRs. It gained significant attention due to its involvement in several large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- #### Infection and Operation
	- Mirai infected IoT devices by exploiting weak or default credentials.
	- Once infected, these devices became part of a botnet, a network of compromised devices controlled by a central server.
	- The botnet was primarily used to launch DDoS attacks on various targets.
- #### DDoS Attacks
	- The Mirai botnet was responsible for some of the largest DDoS attacks in history.
	- It utilized the combined power of thousands of compromised devices to flood target servers with traffic, overwhelming them and causing service disruptions.
	- High-profile targets included websites, online services, and even core internet infrastructure.
- #### Source Code Leak
	- In late 2016, the source code for Mirai was released publicly by its creators.
	- This led to the proliferation of Mirai-based variants and copycat attacks by other hackers and cybercriminals.
- #### Impact
	- The Mirai attacks exposed the vulnerabilities of IoT devices with poor security practices.
	- The attacks highlighted the potential for massive disruption by exploiting a multitude of interconnected devices.
	- The IoT industry faced increased scrutiny to improve security measures.
- #### Legal Action
		- The creators of Mirai were eventually identified and prosecuted.
		- Some of the creators cooperated with law enforcement and provided valuable information about the malware's operation and spread.
- #### Lessons Learned
	- The Mirai case emphasized the importance of securing IoT devices with strong passwords and regular firmware updates.
	- It underscored the need for collaboration between manufacturers, security researchers, and law enforcement to tackle cyber threats effectively.
- #### Ongoing Threat
	- Even after the original Mirai botnet was taken down, its impact continued to influence the landscape of cyber threats.
	- IoT devices remain susceptible to exploitation, and new iterations of Mirai-inspired malware continue to emerge.
	- Botnet? It is a prog hidden within the device and running in the background, provides resources to the attacker using other people's devices
