# Information Security Terminology

- Asset
	- Item of value
	- Asset Types
		- Information
		- Customized Business Software
		- System Software
		- Physical Items
		- Services
- Threat
	- Actions or events that have potential to cause harm
- Threat Agent
	- Person/Element with the power to carry out a threat
		- Can also be natural disasters
- Vulnerability
- Threat Likelihood
- Risk
	- Situation that involves exposure to any sort of danger
	- Dealing with Risk
		- Risk Avoidance: Identifying the risk and not engaging in the activity to create that particular risk
		- Acceptance: Risk is acknowledging the risk exists but no steps are taken to address it
		- Risk mitigation: Address the risks to reduce the severity of the risks
		- Deterrence: Understanding the attacker and then informing them of the consequences
		- Transference: Transfer the risk to a 3rd party

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) 
`Note these were made using chatGPT so bear w some inaccuraices for now`
## Sophistication
- **Advanced Techniques:** APTs utilize cutting-edge attack methods that are beyond typical cybercriminal capabilities. They might employ zero-day exploits, persistence, custom malware, and complex attack chains.
- **Custom Malware:** Attackers create tailored malware specifically designed to evade detection by traditional security measures. This makes it difficult for antivirus software to identify and mitigate the threat.
- **Precision Planning:** APTs are meticulously planned and executed. Attackers invest significant time in reconnaissance to gather intelligence about the target, its systems, and its vulnerabilities.
## Persistence
- **Continuous Access:** Once inside the target's network, APTs aim to maintain access over an extended period, often measured in months or even years. This allows them to gather valuable information and carry out their objectives over time.
- **Backdoors and Implants:** APTs create hidden backdoors and implants within the compromised systems. These serve as entry points for the attackers even if the initial point of entry is discovered and closed.
## Stealth
- **Anti-Detection Techniques:** APTs employ various techniques to evade detection, such as using encryption to hide their communication, disguising their activities as legitimate traffic, and employing anti-analysis mechanisms to hinder security researchers.
- **Avoiding Suspicion:** APTs aim to blend in with normal network activity, avoiding actions that might trigger alarms or raise suspicion.
## Specific Targets
- **High-Value Targets:** APTs often focus on high-value targets such as government agencies, military institutions, defense contractors, large corporations, and organizations with valuable intellectual property.
- **Nation-State Involvement:** APTs are sometimes attributed to nation-states, indicating political or espionage motives. However, some APTs also have financial or criminal motivations.
## Motivation
- **State-Sponsored:** Some APTs are believed to be backed by nation-states, aiming to gather intelligence, carry out cyber espionage, disrupt adversaries, or support political agendas.
- **Financial Gain:** Certain APT groups target financial institutions, critical infrastructure, and businesses to steal sensitive financial information, intellectual property, or engage in cybercrime for monetary gain.
- **Hacktivism:** APTs with hacktivist motives target organizations aligned with their beliefs or political objectives, aiming to create social or political disruption.
