## Revising DNS & DHCP
- IP addresses allow internet connectivity
	- However tough to remember the IP for each website/server we need
- ### DNS
	- Mapping a memorable name to a routable IP Address
		- Also provides Next-Hop router, DNS ,gateway and host IP addresses
- ### DHCP
	- Setting IP address
	- PORTS USED:
		- 67 for server
		- 68 for client
	- Working (all are broadcasts)
		- DHCP discover
			- source IP = 0.0.0.0
			- destination IP = 255.255.255.255
		- DHCP offer
			- source IP = 1.1.1.254/24
			- destination IP = 255.255.255.255 (offer is also broadcast to all)
			- Server sends available IP addresses and options
		- DHCP request 
			- Requests IP from server after selecting from options
			- Basically check if the network has that IP already assigned by using the offered IP and ARP broadcasting
		- DHCP ACK
			- DHCP agrees final comms and ack the IP request
	- VULN
		- **Unauthorized Access**:
			- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the DHCP server, leading to various security risks and network disruptions.
		- **IP Configuration Manipulation**:
			- Attackers can manipulate DHCP to distribute incorrect or malicious IP configurations to clients, potentially disrupting network services and compromising security.
		- **Resource Exhaustion**:
			 - DHCP servers may run out of available IP addresses, causing connectivity issues, or face resource exhaustion due to DoS attacks.
		- **Network Traffic Interception**:
			 - DHCP can be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks, enabling attackers to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
		- **Information Disclosure**:
			 - Poorly configured DHCP servers may leak sensitive information, potentially aiding attackers in exploiting network vulnerabilities.
		- **Option Injection**:
			 - Attackers can inject malicious options into DHCP responses, leading to DNS hijacking and traffic redirection.
		- **DHCP Snooping Bypass**:
			 - Failure to secure switches against rogue DHCP servers can allow attackers to deploy unauthorized DHCP services.
		- **Lease Time Manipulation**:
			- Attackers can manipulate DHCP lease times to maintain control over IP addresses for extended periods, facilitating persistent attacks.
	- Best security practices
		- DHCP Trusted Switches
		- DHCP Fingerprinting
		- Network Monitoring

## URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
`Used ChatGPT for this`
 - ### **Definition**: 
	 - A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a particular resource, either on the internet or in other contexts.
- ### **Types of URIs**:
    - #### **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: 
	    - A specific type of URI that provides the means to locate a resource on the web. URLs include the protocol (e.g., http://), domain, and path.
	    - **Components**:
		    - **Protocol**: Specifies how the resource should be accessed, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.
		    - **Domain**: The web address of the server where the resource is hosted (e.g., [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)).
		    - **Port**: Optional, specifies the port number to use for the connection (e.g., :80 for HTTP).
		    - **Path**: The specific location of the resource on the server's file system.
		    - **Query**: Optional, contains parameters for the resource (e.g., ?id=123).
		    - **Fragment**: Optional, specifies a specific section of the resource (e.g., '#section1').
	- **Example**: Here's a breakdown of a URL:
		- **URL**: [https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?param=value#section](https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?param=value#section)
		- **Protocol**: https
		- **Domain**: [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)
		- **Port**: 8080
		- **Path**: /path/to/resource
		- **Query**: ?param=value
		- **Fragment**:  '#section'
	- **Purpose**: 
		- URLs are used to uniquely identify and locate web resources, including web pages, images, documents, and more.
	- **Format Rules**:
	    - Should not contain spaces or special characters (use URL encoding).
	    - Use lowercase letters for protocol and domain (although it's case-insensitive).
	- **Encoding**: 
		- Special characters in URLs are encoded using percent-encoding (e.g., space becomes %20).
	- **Security**: 
		- URLs with "https" are secure, as they use SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission.
	- **Relative vs. Absolute URLs**: 
		- Relative URLs are based on the current page's URL, while absolute URLs specify the full path.
    - #### **URN (Uniform Resource Name)**: 
	    - Another type of URI that is used to identify resources by name in a particular namespace. URNs are intended to be persistent and location-independent.
- ### **Examples**:
    - **URL**: [https://www.example.com/resource/page.html](https://www.example.com/resource/page.html)
    - **URN**: urn:isbn:0451450523 (identifying a book by ISBN)
- ### **Purpose**: 
	- URIs are used to uniquely identify and access resources, whether they are web pages, documents, or other entities.
- ### **Components**: 
	- URIs typically consist of:
		- **Scheme**: Specifies the type of URI (e.g., http, urn).
		- **Authority**: Often includes domain or address information.
		- **Path**: Identifies the specific resource within the scheme's context.
- ### **URI vs. URL**: 
	- While URIs are a broader concept that includes both URLs and URNs, URLs are a specific type of URI that provides both identification and location information.
