# Introduction

## Data:

Known facts with specific meaning or interpolation while **information** is a precise, understandable and specific representation of data
- ### Terminology
	- Volume == amount
	- Velocity == speed
	- Variety == range of types and sources
- ### Types
	- #### **Unstructured**: No defined structure or organization
		- **Characteristics**:
			- Varied, Complex and unorganized
			- Examples: txt files or media such as images, video and audio even social media posts
		- **Pros**
			- Enables capturing of diverse and rich information.
			- Well-suited for capturing human-generated content.
			- Can include valuable insights not captured by structured data.
		- **Cons:**
			- Difficult to process and analyze without preprocessing.
			- Challenging to search and query effectively.
			- Prone to inconsistency and lack of standardization.
	- #### **Semi-Structured**: Doesn't adhere to strict tabular structure but has some sense of organization
		- **Characteristics**:
			- Flexible, Hierarchical and Tagged
			- Examples: JSON, XML, HTML or NoSQL
		- **Pros:**
			- Offers a balance between flexibility and organization.
			- Allows for easier storage and processing compared to unstructured data.
			- Well-suited for representing hierarchical and nested data.
			- Storing and exchanging data between systems with different protocols/schemes and webscraping
		- **Cons:**
			- Still requires some level of preprocessing for analysis.
			- Lack of strict schema can lead to data quality issues.
			- Querying might be more complex compared to structured data.
	- #### **Structured**: Tabulated data/High level of organization seen by rows & cols
		- **Characteristics**:
			- Organized, Tabular and Standardized
			- Suited for SQL queries and Data analysis as it is stored in a relational model
		- **Pros:**
			- Easily organized in tabular format, suitable for databases.
			- Supports efficient querying using SQL or other structured query languages.
			- Highly suitable for quantitative analysis and reporting.
		- **Cons:**
			- May not capture the full complexity of real-world scenarios.
			- Limited in representing unstructured or loosely structured information.
			- Changes to the schema can be challenging and require careful migration.

## Filing system:

Still used as the traditional way to handle data generated through paperwork. Used only if a system to handle data in a precise way is still in use and transitioning to a digital means is hard
- ### Issues:
- `Note: These issues also translate over to an actual DBMS as well`
	- **Data Integrity**
		- Definition: Inaccurate/altered documents, issues with maintaining a file.
		- Causes limited querying and response time
	- **Data inconsistency**
		- Definition: Occurs when two or more copies of the same data have conflicting changes and were updated by two people without communication
		- Causes issues with tracking the latest file and also wastes space
	- **Data redundancy**
		- Definition: Duplicate instances of the same record within a system usually caused by saving copies of a file with small differences
		- Causes retrieval of files to be more difficult and also wastes space
	- **Data Isolation**
		- Definition: Same file, scattered between two points with no relationship. In a DMBS this would be due to two users being able to write to a file
		- Causes confusion, loss of information and inefficiency
	- **Data Atomicity**
		- Definition: Incomplete/Partial changes made to the data, a write fail can cause the database to
		- Causes data inaccuracies and compromises reliability of the system

## Database Management System (DBMS)

A digitized system where data is collected and queried
- ### Stages of Creating a DB Model
	- **Design**: Define Structure and what type of data to take in
		- Process: Create an ERD (Entity-Relationship-Diagram) to define the database's blueprint
	- **Construct**: Create Structure and ingest data
		- Process: Use SQL to create the database that will hold the data it is tailored to
	- **Manipulation of data**: Create, Read, Write, Update and Delete entries
	- **Query**: Request Data
	- **Create Reports**: Present queried Data in a table
- ### Advantages of using a DBMS
	- **Controlling Redundancy**
	- **Controlled Access**
	- **Persistent Storage for programs**
	- **Efficient Query Processing**
	- **Backup and Recovery**
	- **Multiple User interfaces**
	- **Represent Complex Relationships among data**
	- **Enforce Integrity Constraints**

Review Questions:
1) Define the following terms
- Data: Information in its raw and unorganized form, typically consisting of facts, figures, or statistics.
- Database: A structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed for efficient retrieval and manipulation.
- DBMS (Database Management System): Software that provides an interface for users and applications to interact with databases, managing tasks like data storage, retrieval, and security.
- Database Catalog: A repository within a DBMS that stores metadata, which includes information about the structure, organization, and relationships within the database.
- Program-Data Independence: The ability to modify programs without affecting the structure or organization of the data they use.
- User View: A subset of the database that a specific user or application is authorized to access, showing only the relevant data.
- DBA (Database Administrator): A professional responsible for managing and maintaining the database, ensuring its availability, security, performance, and integrity.
- End User: The individuals or entities who interact directly with the database to perform specific tasks or obtain information.
- Canned Transaction: A pre-defined sequence of operations or transactions that are packaged together for execution, often used for routine tasks.
- Deductive Database System: A type of database system that incorporates logic-based reasoning and supports deductive queries.
- Persistent Object: An object in object-oriented programming that retains its state even after the program has terminated.
- Meta-data: Data that describes other data, providing information about the structure, attributes, and relationships of the data.
- Transaction-Processing Application: Software applications designed to handle transactions, which are discrete units of work, often involving the modification of data in a database.

1) What four main types of actions involve databases? Briefly discuss each.
	- Data Definition
	- Data Manipulation
	- Data Retrieval
	- Data administration
2) Discuss the main characteristics of the database approach and how it differs from traditional file systems.
	- The database approach offers several advantages over traditional file systems, including data integrity, data sharing, reduced data redundancy, improved data security, and centralized data management. Unlike file systems, databases use a structured and organized approach to data storage, allowing for efficient querying and manipulation.
3) What are the responsibilities of the DBA and the database designers? 
	- DBA Responsibilities: DBAs are responsible for database design, security, performance tuning, backup and recovery, user management, and ensuring data integrity and availability.
	- Database Designers: They design the database schema, define relationships between tables, choose appropriate data types, and ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.
4) What are the different types of database end users? Discuss the main activities of each. 
	- Casual End Users: Occasionally access the database to retrieve specific information.
	- Naive End Users: Interact with the database through predefined forms and canned transactions.
	- Sophisticated End Users: Formulate ad hoc queries and generate reports.
	- Stand-Alone Users: Maintain personal databases using desktop tools.
5) Discuss the capabilities that should be provided by a DBMS. 
	- Data Storage and Retrieval: Efficiently store and retrieve large volumes of data.
	- Data Security: Implement user authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
	- Data Integrity: Enforce data integrity constraints to ensure accurate and consistent data.
	- Concurrency Control: Manage simultaneous access to the database by multiple users.
	- Data Backup and Recovery: Provide mechanisms for data backup and disaster recovery.
	- Query Language: Offer a language (e.g., SQL) for users to interact with the database.
	- Transaction Management: Handle atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) of transactions.
6) Discuss the differences between database systems and information retrieval systems.
	- Purpose: Database systems manage structured data with relationships, while information retrieval systems focus on searching and retrieving unstructured or semi-structured data.
	- Data Organization: Databases use a structured schema, while information retrieval systems may use indexing and ranking for unstructured data.
	- Query Complexity: Database systems support complex queries with relationships, while retrieval systems often rely on keyword-based searches.
	- Data Consistency: Databases ensure data consistency and integrity, while retrieval systems may prioritize search speed over data accuracy.
